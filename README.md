gup

This script allows you to overwrite your local repository with the remote commits.
(I know often there are cases that you want this feature)

`How to install`

```
$ ./installer
```

go to your git directory and

```
$ gup
```

then, the latest commit in the rmeote repository fetched without any conflicts.
